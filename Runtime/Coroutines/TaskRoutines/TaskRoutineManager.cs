/// TaskRoutineManager.cs
///
/// This is a convenient coroutine API for Unity.
///
/// Example usage:
///   IEnumerator MyAwesomeTask()
///   {
///       while(true) {
///           // ...
///           yield return null;
////      }
///   }
///
///   IEnumerator TaskKiller(float delay, Task t)
///   {
///       yield return new WaitForSeconds(delay);
///       t.Stop();
///   }
///
///   // From anywhere
///   TaskRoutine my_task = new TaskRoutine(MyAwesomeTask());
///   new TaskRoutine(TaskKiller(5, my_task));
///
/// The code above will schedule MyAwesomeTask() and keep it running
/// concurrently until either it terminates on its own, or 5 seconds elapses
/// and triggers the TaskKiller Task that was created.
///
/// Note that to facilitate this API's behavior, a "TaskRoutine" GameObject is
/// created lazily on first use of the Task API and placed in the scene root
/// with the internal TaskManager component attached. All coroutine dispatch
/// for Tasks is done through this component.
